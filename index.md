Squall's Dead

Based on an idea by duckroll

"Squall's Dead" discusses the possibility of Final Fantasy
VIII's storyline covertly revolving around the death of its main
character early on, a theory which - so far - appears to be undiscussed
on the internets. We will attempt to explain the basis of the theory,
and argue why it may be true. At the end of the article we concede that
there is no real "proof", merely suggestions and hints. However, we hope
this analysis will add meaning to the game for all players - perhaps
refreshing its value over a decade since the game's release - and
inspire a discussion as it did between us.

With that said, let's get on with it!

The Theory
==========

At the end of disc one, Squall and Friends face Edea on a parade float
in Deling City. After the fight, when Edea seems defeated, she conjures
an enormous ice shard and propels it through Squall’s chest. Squall
stumbles back and falls off the platform. He sees Rinoa above, reaching
to him as he falls. Squall closes his eyes and dies. The entire
remaining game time, from the beginning of disc two to the second half
of the ending movie, is a dream.

A dream?
========

Uh huh. A dream, a fantasy, a vision, or whatever you want to call it.
The “dream” is basically an extension of the “your life flashes before
your eyes” concept. The entire dream takes only a matter of seconds, but
for Squall is passes in real time. For Squall, it’s about the endless
possibilities he could have seen realized. Squall explores the questions
that were raised on the first disc but he was not able to answer in his
lifetime. These questions include, but are not limited to:

Who is the Sorceress Edea? What are her goals and motivation? Where do
her powers come from? Why was Seifer in the parade with Edea when he was
reported executed? Who was the girl (Ellone) that Squall and Quistis saw
in the Garden training center? Who is Laguna and why did Squall,
Selphie, and Zell all have the same dream about him? And, most
importantly, who is Squall? Who were his parents? Why did they leave him
at the orphanage? Where does he come from, and what would he have done
with his life had he not died?

Standard interpretations of the story
=====================================

Today’s understanding of the events of Final Fantasy VIII comprise of a
mixed bag. Most people focus on who Ultimecia is, what her motives are,
and what happens after her defeat. This has led to the misinterpretation
of the evidence and symbolism pointing towards Squall’s death. Some
evidence that formerly appeared to be vague and inconclusive now
represent clear allusions and references to the subtlety of Final
Fantasy VIII’s “obscured” meaning.

In fact, the popular opinion of Final Fantasy VIII falls exactly in line
with the nature of the elements of the plot that are consistent within
the dream theory, and those that are not. For instance, one of the
biggest criticisms of the game is that the “orphanage plot twist”
appears to be completely random and come out of nowhere. It appears to
be too convenient, for how could all the main characters have possibly
grown up together in the same orphanage? The brilliance of the dream
theory is that it addresses concerns like these and offers a logical
explanation.

Supporting Evidence
===================

1. You've become just a memory
------------------------------

In the latter half of disc one, two conversations take place concerning
Seifer’s fate and if he will be executed for attacking the president of
Galbadia. During these sections of dialogue, Squall muses to himself on
the existential qualities of death. “Will they talk about me this way if
I die too? Squall was this and that. Using the past tense, saying
whatever they want? So this is what death is all about…” In this manner
Squall considers his own death and what little difference it will make
for the world. This serves as foreboding, an ominous suggestion to the
viewer that ill times are ahead.

Also note this excerpt from the first conversation concerning Seifer’s
possible execution:

> ‘(Think what you want...Reality isn't so kind. Everything doesn't work
> out the way you want it to. That's why...) "As long as you don't get
> your hopes up, you can take anything... You feel less pain. Anyway,
> whatever wish you have is none of my business."’

Here Squall states the obvious: Shit happens. People die, and there’s
nothing you can do about it. That’s just the way the world is.
“Everything doesn’t work out the way you want it to.” Not only is this
foreshadowing, but it’s also contrary to what some consider a central
theme to Final Fantasy VIII’s story: fate. (We’ll come back to this
point later.)

2. My wound? …No wound…?
------------------------

The attempted assassination of Edea by SeeD at Deling City at the end of
Disc 1 is where everything starts (and ends). Squall engages Edea and
Seifer in battle on the parade float. After the battle ends, Edea casts
a spell on him.

Here's the video:

After the encounter between Squall and Edea, Squall wakes up in a cell
in the Galbadian desert prison. His first dialogue is:

> ‘(...Where am I? I...challenged Edea... My wound...? No wound...?
> How...? The Galbadian soldiers... ...We were surrounded. He was
> there... Seifer, leering down at me.) "Damn you, Seifer!"’

Apparently Squall’s healthy and good-to-go. It is never again referenced
directly in the entire game, nor is it ever explained what happened to
his wound or how he survived. And remember, a piece of ice half as long
as Squall himself went through his chest and came out the other side.
This is no mere scratch that is so carelessly tossed aside. Most players
seem to assume that Edea healed Squall to full health for the purpose of
interrogation, but why would she? Seifer knows that Squall is no great
captain from Balamb Garden. He’s no more privy to top secret information
than are the other three. If Edea wanted to know more about SeeD, she
should be interrogating Quistis, who’s been a SeeD for three years and
who has been teaching SeeDs for one year. Squall has been a SeeD for all
of two weeks. Why go through all the effort of killing him just to bring
him to full health when he’s obviously a threat to her?

3. “I don’t know what’s going on anymore!”
------------------------------------------

As some of you may have noticed, the plot takes a few unanticipated
turns after the end of disc one. At first the transition is rather
subtle. When plot twists are introduced, they are fully explained and
are not in conflict with existing plot information. In fact, the more
you learn about this world, the more everything seems to make perfect
sense. Everything fits together in an elaborate but perfectly designed
puzzle. Everything connects and everything is related. And yet it still
seems absolutely ridiculous.

The story takes on a dream-like quality that centers itself on Squall
and everything Squall has ever wanted. The dream goes on to explain
everything Squall wanted to know, but it also treads through the realm
of egoist fantasy. It spins off into a world of impossible where
monsters come from the moon and Squall, merely a newly recruited cadet,
goes on to save our world as we know it from an evil sorceress from the
future. And he gets the girl. Let’s look at some specific examples.

### a. One word: MOOMBAS.

As soon as I saw those red lion Pokémons running around on the screen, I
knew there was something strange happening.

The first disc had a fairly high level of realism despite the fantasy
and low sci-fi topics present. The characters were all human, and
outside of “monsters” there were no unearthly creatures to be seen.
Rinoa had a dog that attacks for her at times, as earthly dogs are known
to do. But there weren’t any fluffy feline creatures running around
yelling “Laguna! Laguna!”

Of course, Moombas are explained within the context of the game. In the
Shumi Village you can learn who the Moombas are, who they evolve from,
and so on and so forth. The game takes the plot developments of the
dream very seriously and treats them all as truth, which makes the dream
theory especially difficult to argue. Sure, all this stuff seems weird,
but how do we know that it’s all intended to be a dream? Maybe the
creators just thought it’d be cool to have talking cats around! And who
knows, maybe they did. But I think it’s more than convenient that the
more fantastical elements, such as talking lions, do not appear in the
game until after the moment where Squall may have died.

It should also be noted that Moombas, these benevolent creatures that
try to help Squall and his friends escape despite their limited verbal
communication, are literally lions. And lions, of course, are of
particular importance to Squall whose symbol is a lion named Griever.
The moombas and the Griever’s appearance in the final battle with
Ultimecia can therefore be explained as manifestations of Squall’s mind.

### b. Fushururu...3-SECONDS-ARE-UP

Okay, we already covered the Moombas and the Shumi, but I still wanted
to say:

Wtf?! The Master of Garden is a giant yellow sloth alien creature? You
gotta be kidding me!!

I dunno about you guys, but this is typical dream material in my
opinion. Of course, NORG and his kind are fully explained in the game if
you take the time to seek the information they present, but there are no
hints presented in the story to suggest this sort of twist was coming.
When walking around the Garden in the beginning of the game, you often
see the cult-looking guys in red robes wandering about and sometimes
conversing with you briefly. I more than once thought they looked a bit
creepy though, and I can easily imagine that Squall would have thought
the same and integrated their possible backstory into his dream.

Not only is there no evidence leading up to this discovery, after Squall
and Friends kill NORG, that’s it. Nothing happens. Squall speaks to Cid,
but he doesn’t even talk about it. I expected him at least to say, “Oh,
by the way Cid, I just killed that big slimy dude that was hanging
around in the basement yelling orders and acting all powerful and stuff.
Hope that’s no prob’.” There’s no retaliation, no consequences, nothing.
The story goes on as if NORG had never come into it.

Also in the NORG section, another little twist comes to the surface. Cid
and Edea are married! It’s another typical twist; the only important
older male character and the only important older female character are
married and have a backstory that goes back decades. And, like NORG, it
comes completely out of left-field. The twist does not conflict with
existing story information, yet it seems so out-of-place and
unrealistic.

I’m not even going to bother discussing the floating Garden. You guys
get the point.

### c. Perhaps it’s fate.

And we’re back to the fate question. What I wanted to point out on the
subject of fate and destiny and all that hullabaloo is simply this: the
subject of fate does not come up until after the end of disc one. The
word “fate” comes up only once on the first disc. When Squall and
Friends get the last train for Deling City moments before it disembarks,
Irvine comments on the luck by saying, "Hmm... Perhaps it's fate?" After
the first disc of the game, however, fate becomes a frequent subject of
conversation. It’s SeeD’s destiny to defeat the Sorceress; it’s Squall’s
fate to lead Garden; Squall’s destined to face Seifer, etc.

Fate becomes such a prevalent topic that many players come away feeling
that fate was one of the most important elements of the Final Fantasy
VIII story and the answer to all questions. Fate is the reason why this
lowly cadet instantaneously becomes the leader of Garden. Fate is the
reason why everyone in your party apparently knew each other as
children. Fate is the reason why everything falls into place like a
perfect fantasy.

### d. Just stay close to me.

Speaking of a perfect fantasy, the romantic storyline of Final Fantasy
VIII is just that. The romantic plotline, which many fans consider to
the most successful element of the game, is completely fabricated for
Squall’s personal satisfaction. Not only does Rinoa show little
appreciation for Squall through disc one, but there are many allusions
to her on-going relationship with Seifer. Their relationship appears to
have been on a sort of hiatus while Seifer was studying at the Balamb
Garden, but their affection and romantic connection is still in place
when this story occurs.

In the ballroom scene, Rinoa flirts with Squall casually, but appears to
take no actual interest in him as an individual. She tells him honestly,
as she drags him out to dance, that she’s waiting for someone else.

> Squall: “...I can't dance.”\
> Rinoa: “You'll be fine. Come on. I'm looking for someone. I can't be
> on the dance floor alone.”

After a quick dance and a swoon from the female fans, Rinoa wordlessly
brushes him off and leaves to find Seifer. Her abruptness suggests that
her real interest lies elsewhere. The next time Squall sees Rinoa, it’s
in Timber. Rinoa is overjoyed to see him, but only because he’s a member
of SeeD.

> Rinoa: "Hey... You're...! You know, from the party... So...does that
> mean... You're a SeeD!?"\
> Squall: "I'm Squall, the squad leader. There's two others with me."\
> Rinoa: "YEEESSSS! SeeD is here!"

Here we also learn that Rinoa knows Seifer, from the party and from
before. Her demeanor suggests a fondness for him that she does not
openly let on.

> Squall: "Oh... So you were looking for the headmaster at the party?"\
>  Rinoa: "You know Seifer?"\
>  Squall: "...Yeah."\
>  Rinoa: "Well, he's the one who introduced me to Cid. Cid is such a
> nice man. I really didn't think SeeD would come out to help a measly
> little group like us. But after explaining our situation to him, Cid
> gave the go ahead right away! Now that you guys are here, we'll be
> able to carry out all kinds of plans!"\
>  ……\
>  Squall: "I'm goin' back to the others."\
>  Rinoa: "Ok, let's go! Umm, Squall. Is 'he' here?"\
>  Squall: ('He'?)\
>  Rinoa: "Seifer."\
>  Squall: "...... No, he's not a SeeD."

After the events at Timber, when the party discusses Seifer’s execution,
Rinoa speaks more openly on her relationship with Seifer.

> Rinoa: "I...really liked him. He was always full of confidence,
> smart... Just by talking to him, I felt like I could take on the
> world."\
>  Selphie: "Your boyfriend?"\
>  Rinoa: "I don't really know. I... I think it was love. I wonder how
> he felt...?"\
>  Selphie: "Do you still like him?"\
>  Rinoa: "If I didn't, I wouldn't be talking about it. It was last
> summer... I was 16. Lots of fond memories..."

Firstly, Rinoa is obviously quite taken with Seifer, and though she
doesn’t classify herself as his girlfriend, she admits she thinks it may
be love. This is not a good beginning to a love story for Squall and
Rinoa. Secondly, Rinoa appears to fully dislike Squall’s cold and
introverted personality. She calls him mean, callous, insensitive, and
chastises him for not communicating his thoughts to her and the others
in the party.

Rinoa does not show Squall the least bit of affection until the end of
disc one when Squall and Irvine save her from some strange iguana
creatures. In this scene, she clutches Squall’s arm shamelessly in her
traumatized state.

> Rinoa: "I was scared..." [Rinoa clings to his arm.] "...Really
> scared."\
>  Squall: "It's over now."\
>  Rinoa: "I was scared... I was really, really scared."\
>  Squall: "You're used to battles, aren't you?"\
>  Rinoa: "I couldn't...I just couldn't. I couldn't fight alone..."\
>  Squall: (...You're not ready for all this.) "Better get going."
> [Rinoa clings to his arm again after he bats it away.] "I haven't
> forgotten your order. Just stay close to me."

A few moments later, at the sniper position, Squall considers the
possibility that he may have to fight Seifer as an enemy. He mentions
the possibility to Rinoa, who obviously may be heavily affected by
Squall trying to kill her romantic interest.

> Squall: "Rinoa. Seifer's alive. He was in the parade with the
> sorceress."\
>  Rinoa: "...What does it mean?"\
>  Squall: "Who knows." (If I were to face the sorceress directly...
> Would I have to go through Seifer? ...That's the way it goes as a
> SeeD. You can't choose your enemies...) "I may end up killing
> Seifer."\
>  Rinoa: "You're both...prepared, right? That's the kind of world you
> live in. You've had a lot of emotional training. But... Of course, I'd
> rather it not happen..."

Rinoa appears to accept that if Seifer is protecting the Sorceress, it
is necessary to dispose of him.

I think it’s important to note that at this point in the game, at the
end of disc one, Squall is aware of Rinoa’s relationship with Seifer and
does not seem threatened by it. Furthermore, Squall does not want to
kill Seifer. Squall and Seifer have a history of quarrels and petty
competition, but Seifer is still a comrade. In the final exam in Balamb,
Squall and Zell worked together with Seifer despite their differences.
The only reason to kill Seifer is his apparent alignment with the
Sorceress, which is never fully explained.

After disc one, the complexity of this situation becomes much simpler.
The relationship Rinoa and Seifer had is never again mentioned, except
by Seifer in the form of taunts during battle. Rinoa herself seems to
have completely distanced herself from Seifer, and Seifer’s enemy status
is never again questioned. Seifer began as a rather complex character,
an enemy at times to Squall and Zell but still a friend in battle. He
broke out of the Garden’s disciplinary wing to risk his life for Rinoa,
who found his courage inspiring. After disc one he is a villain and his
only goal appears to be serving the Sorceress. I personally expected
Seifer to have been brain-washed or mind-controlled, and I spent a
majority of the game waiting for Seifer to “snap out of it” and join
Squall’s team, but he never does. The story just accepts that Seifer is
now evil and must be killed. It’s so simple and, well, convenient.

Seifer, who was Squall’s personal tormenter and rival in school, has
become a major villain to the world and all of his friends. And since
Seifer is out of the way, his would-be girlfriend--Rinoa--is now single
and apparently falling for Squall though she never took an interest in
him before.

4. The End
----------

At the very end of the game, just as you’re beating the final boss,
Ultimecia, she starts to say some strange things, statements that appear
very out-of-context for a final battle.

> "Reflect on your... Childhood..."\
>  "Your sensation... Your words... Your emotions..."\
>  "Time... It will not wait..."\
>  "No matter... ...how hard you hold on. It escapes you..."

When I read those words, a chill ran up my spine. With every attack, you
bring down Ultimecia’s hit points, and you bring Squall’s dream to a
close. Squall, oblivious, fights on, and only this figment of his
imagination seems aware of what is happening.

There is a short story segment here involving Squall going back in time
to the orphanage and seeing Ultimecia pass on her powers to Edea in the
past. Then Squall leaves in search of his “own time”, and is shown
wandering in a desert place. He appears to be “lost in time” and unable
to find his way back his normal time period.

![Squall sits alone in a desolate landscape.](endshot1.jpg)

Squall finds himself on a small rock island, isolated and helpless. He
drops himself on the ground, exhausted. Then, upon catching a feather
floating towards him, he finds himself where Rinoa is. He calls out her
name, and she turns to face him. This is where the weird shit starts
happening.

Rinoa turns to Squall, but her face is blurred. There’s a shot of Seifer
as the movie cuts to the ballroom scene. Here we see Rinoa again, and
again she turns towards the camera as she did in the ballroom scene on
disc one. But she’s blurry and messed up again. The shot continues to
repeat, and every time Rinoa’s face and form are blurred, and the effect
seems to be getting worse each time. What is happening here?

![Rinoa is seen with her face blurred during the ballroom
scene.](endshot2.jpg)

It is my belief that as Squall’s dream is coming to a close, he is
starting to lose touch with his own memories. He is trying to picture
Rinoa, the object of his fantasy, but he can’t quite remember the shape
of her face. He is going over that moment in the ballroom, when he first
saw her, again and again in his mind, focusing closer on her face and
trying to see her the way that she was.

I have seen this specific visual symbolism once before, in *Eternal
Sunshine on the Spotless Mind*. In *Eternal Sunshine*, the protagonist,
Joel, has his memory erased because he wants to forget his
ex-girlfriend. But, in the course of the procedure, Joel realizes what
he is losing and tries to hold on to his precious memories. He tries to
remember the things they have already erased, just to find the
characters in his memory are faceless, blurred beyond recognition.

As Squall is visualizing Rinoa in the ballroom, we start to see some
quick shots interrupting the movie. The first one, as I already
mentioned, was of Seifer. What is noteworthy about the shot of Seifer is
that it shows him in the torchlight from the parade float where Edea
tried to kill Squall with an ice spell.

![Seifer's menacing face from the parade float at Deling
City.](endshot3.jpg)

Then some quick shots of Rinoa appear. These are as blurred as the Rinoa
from the ballroom scene, but these images of Rinoa come from the scene
where Edea makes her speech before the parade. Rinoa, who appears to be
under Edea’s spell, follows the Sorceress out see the screaming crowd.

![Rinoa, her face blurred, staggers ahead after being mind controlled by
Edea at Deling City.](endshot4.jpg)

We see some shots of Rinoa floating in space, and then we’re back in the
ballroom looking for Rinoa. Then there is another assortment of shots
from throughout the first disc of the game. First we see the mechanical
spider monster from the final exam in Balamb followed by a shot of each
of the party members but Squall (Quistis, Zell, Rinoa, Selphie, and
Irvine, in that order). The images of Quistis, Zell, and Selphie are
from the final exam in Balamb, and the shot of Irvine is from his
introductory fmv clip. This is the shot of Rinoa:

![Rinoa turns, her mouth agape, as Squall is impaled by a shard of
ice.](endshot5.jpg)

This frame was taken directly from the scene in which Squall was killed.
Rinoa is turning to Squall, who has just been impaled.

We see some shots of the Balamb communications tower, the Ragnarok, and
there’s a clip of Rinoa, still blurred, with her hair in the wind. A
shot of Seifer pushing Rinoa into Adel goes by, then we see more of the
Balamb tower, and a clip of Rinoa reaching to Squall from the parade
float.

![Rinoa is seen again, reaching out to Squall as he falls from the
float, but the image is blurry.](endshot6.jpg)

There’s an explosion, and we see the arch from Deling City under which
Squall died. The camera takes us through the arch and we’re back in the
ballroom for more blurred face action. There are a lot of images in this
section, including Edea from the parade float, Ultimecia, Rinoa in
space, the eyes from all the cast members fading into each other, and
probably a lot more than that. There’s also a frame from the last moment
in disc one, the image of Squall’s eye as he falls from the parade
float.

![A shot from the ending where different scenes blend together. An eye
is seen superimposed over the ballroom dance.](endshot7.jpg)

At this point in the movie, and for the last few minutes as well,
Squall’s life has literally been flashing before his eyes. I feel that
there is a particular focus on the two main events of disc one: the
final exam at Balamb and the encounter with Edea on the parade float.
But of course the ballroom scene, which was of particular importance to
Squall, is by far the most covered event in the first half of the ending
fmv. However, as I’ve been mentioning throughout this section, there are
also snippets of images from the latter half of the game, particularly
Rinoa in space.

At the very end of this part of the ending movie, we see Rinoa coming
towards the camera, arms open for embrace. As before, the closer she
gets, the more obscured she becomes. Then we see our first shot of
Squall.

![Squall's head is displayed, but instead of his face he has only a
gaping black hole to fill in his features.](endshot8.jpg)

This shot keeps me up at night. Seriously.

So far, the best analysis I have this for this screenshot is that Squall
feels empty, that he losing his sense of self and everything that comes
with it. He’s having trouble visualizing his memories, or even
remembering reality from fiction. Think back to what Ultimecia said, at
the end of the last battle. "Reflect on your... Childhood… Your
sensation... Your words... Your emotions... Time... It will not wait...
No matter... ...how hard you hold on. It escapes you..." His life is
fading from him. You can’t hold on forever.

Or they just wanted to give me nightmares.

![Rinoa is seen in space, her helmet exploding outward into shards of
glass.](endshot9.jpg)

There is one last shot of Rinoa, floating in space. The glass on her
space helmet cracks and sends large pointed shards towards the camera.
There is a sound, like someone being struck by a sword. We cut to
Squall, eyes wide, a tear escaping him. He throws back his head and is
consumed by white.

Here's a video of the ending up to this point:

And now, finally, Squall is dead. We see a white feather fall to the
ground, and the screen fades to black. The last ten minutes of the
FFVIII ending movie are, in the simplest terms, of “heaven”, or some
equivalent thereof.

That horrible ‘Eyes on Me’ song boots up, and we see Rinoa wandering
around. She finds Squall, and holds him, apparently thinking he’s dead.
The clouds whirl open so the sun can shine through, pink flower petals
swirl in the wind across a gorgeous green grassy plain, and Rinoa looks
back to Squall with a look of amazement. Those pink petals turn to white
feathers on the wind, and the movie cuts to Balamb.

At the Balamb port we see Seifer, Fujin and Raijin fishing in the same
gorgeous sunny weather that Squall and Rinoa were experiencing. Fujin
kicks Raijin into the bright blue water, and Seifer cracks up laughing
like a schoolboy. Seifer, who I thought we had finally defeated for the
last time, looks up and smiles as Balamb Garden sails by overhead.

![A laughing Seifer is seen against a blue sky backdrop on a sunny
day.](endshot11.jpg)

The movie cuts to Laguna, who’s standing out at Raine’s grave. We get to
see Laguna propose to Raine in the past, and they embrace. Laguna in the
present sees Ellone coming back to see him, and they look up as the
Balamb Garden goes over them as well.

During the credits they show a home video-type clip where all the
characters get to act like complete retards. All the party members are
there celebrating but Squall and Rinoa, and even Cid and Edea are in
attendance. Irvine dances like a goon, Selphie bounces around like an
airhead, and Zell stuffs his face with hotdogs. Yay.

After the final credits we get to see the stuff that makes the fangirls
go wild. Rinoa stands out on the Garden’s balcony with Squall under a
starry night sky. She raises her finger, just as Squall remembers, and
Squall smiles back at her.

![Squall turns to the camera and smiles.](endshot12.jpg)

Watch the second part of the ending below:

One last thing
==============

If this was really how the game was meant to be interpreted, why did
they make the “dream” so subtle? I can think of fifty ways to make it
more apparent to the audience that the events taking place after disc
one are not real. So, if the creators meant for Squall to die, they also
meant for his death to be obscured and subtle. We view the dream as if
we are the dreamers, and even though sometimes events take place that
could never, ever happen in the “real” world, we do not become aware
that it is a dream.

A similar plot can be seen in the film *Vanilla Sky* (just fyi, if you
haven’t seen it, don’t read on; spoilers etc) in which Tom Cruise plays
a character who chooses to have himself put to sleep. At a certain point
in the movie, he begins dreaming, and the entire remainder of the film
is a fabrication of his mind. At first there is little indication that
anything is amiss. The plot continues as though nothing is different,
except of course that everything starts to go his way.

After a while, though, things start to get a little crazy, and he ends
up awaiting the death penalty for beating his girlfriend to death during
sex while experiencing what appeared to be a delusion. And all the while
the audience watches on in confusion, as unaware as the character that
this is all just a dream. Now, the problem I had with Vanilla Sky was
that they couldn’t just leave it alone. I think it would have been a
really cool movie if they had left it up to us to discern what had
really happened. Instead we, the audience, received a full exposition
dump in the final moments of the film as a character carefully explains
to the protagonist, and the audience, that the whole movie was really
just a dream.

Maybe the only real difference between Final Fantasy VIII and Vanilla
Sky is: they just never told us what really happened. In Final Fantasy
VIII, they let us live in the dream as Squall did and we never know the
difference.

Conclusion
==========

The truth is, I don’t think there is a substantial amount of evidence to
conclude whether or not the writers intended for the audience to
interpret the game in this fashion. I choose to believe that this is how
the game was intended to be understood because, to me, the game makes no
sense otherwise. Everything that happens to the characters after the
first disc is ridiculous. The ending is like recapping the game on acid.
There has to be something more to the story than a simple ‘Hero Takes
All’ plot.

Sometimes, while writing this article, I really felt that this is the
real story of Final Fantasy VIII. But sometimes it all just sounds like
poppycock to me. In any case, I think Squall's Dead is an interesting
theory, worth considering at least, and I hope you think so too.
